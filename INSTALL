ImageJ Analysis
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

ImageJ analysis is performed using the GDSC plugins for ImageJ. ImageJ and the 
plugins must be installed on the OMERO server that runs the scripts. The 
following sections describe the install requirements.


ImageJ
------

ImageJ can be obtained from the ImageJ website:

http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html

The scripts have been tested with v1.45+. Newer versions should be supported.

ImageJ can be installed to any location that is visible by the OMERO server.


GDSC ImageJ plugins
-------------------

ImageJ analysis is performed using the GDSC plugins for ImageJ. These
can be obtained from the GDSC ImageJ plugins website: 

http://www.sussex.ac.uk/gdsc/intranet/microscopy/imagej/gdsc_plugins

The plugins are written to output the results as text which is captured by the 
OMERO scripts in a file. The results are then parsed and uploaded to OMERO or 
e-mailed to the user.

The GDSC ImageJ plugins should be placed into the 'plugins' folder of the ImageJ 
install.


Java Headless mode (Unix only)
------------------------------

ImageJ is run by the scripts using the ImageJ batch mode. This assumes a 
headless Java environment (i.e. no graphical output). In this mode ImageJ is 
purely an image analysis program with no user interaction. Unfortunately 
on the Unix-derived operating system the headless mode still requires a graphics 
device when using some of the core libraries. To allow ImageJ to run on an 
OMERO server without a configured graphical output various ImageJ classes 
have been rewritten to not use the core Java libraries. Only the classes used
by the GDSC plugins have been changed.

The headless.jar with source code is available in the GitHub repository 
containing all the GDSC OMERO scripts. Feel free to modify and distribute this
code.

The headless.jar can be installed to any location that is visible by the OMERO 
server.


OMERO scripts
-------------

The install locations for ImageJ can be configured using variables at the top
of the scripts:

- Correlation_Analyser.py
- Colocalisation_Analyser.py

* IMAGEJ_CLASSPATH

The ImageJ classpath must contain the full path to ij.jar. If using a Unix
operating system the classpath must contain the full path to the headless.jar
before the ij.jar (separated using :).

Default: "/usr/local/ImageJ/headless.jar:/usr/local/ImageJ/ij.jar"

* IMAGEJ_PATH

The location of the ImageJ install (v1.45+). The [ImageJ]/plugins directory 
must contain the gdsc_.jar ImageJ plugin.

Default: "/usr/local/ImageJ"

* ADMIN_EMAIL 

The e-mail address that messages are sent from. Make this a valid address so 
that the user can reply to the message.

Default: 'admin@omero.host.com'


SMTP setup
----------

The OMERO script have the ability to e-mail results to the user. This is done
using the Python modules smtplib and email. The e-mails are sent using the 
module defaults, i.e. using a server URL of localhost at port 25. If the host 
machine running OMERO has an alternative SMTP configuration then please 
consult the system administrator for SMTP set-up details. The OMERO scripts
will have to be updated to use the alternative SMTP server.


Command-line execution
----------------------

The scripts have been written to allow exceution outside of the OMERO scripting
environment. The scripts will require the OMERO environment is set-up in the 
host shell. Details of the required OMERO environment variables can be found 
here:

http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/sysadmins/unix/server-installation.html

The key is to include the OMERO python libraries on the PYTHONPATH otherwise
the script will not be able to import the OMERO python modules. The ICE_CONFIG
variable can be used to specify the OMERO host. An example configuration for
the C-shell (csh) on a UNIX platform is show below:

---
setenv OMERO_HOME /usr/local/omero_dist
setenv ICE_HOME /opt/Ice-3.3.1

# Need ICE_HOME python stuff for python scripting API
setenv PYTHONPATH /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6:${ICE_HOME}/python/:${OMERO_HOME}/lib/python:${PYTHONPATH}

# Used to set the config file for ICE properties.
setenv ICE_CONFIG /home/omero/ice_config
---

The ice_config file contains the OMERO host:

omero.host=localhost

If the environment is correctly configured the scripts can be called from a 
command-line passing the argument 'run':

% ./Colocalisation_Analyser.py run

The script will prompt the user to enter the OMERO connection details (user,
password, server and port). The script then runs using hard-coded parameter 
configuration (which can be changed to suit the testing protocol). The command-
line run-mode provides an example of running image analysis using images stored 
in OMERO. It also provides a method to debug the scripts before deployment to 
the server.
